If you run a profitable business—whether it’s a **Matriculation School in Neyveli**, a **Hotel in Pondicherry**, or a **Cashew Factory in Panruti**—you face two major drains on your cash flow:
1.  **Electricity Bills:** Rising at 5% per year.
2.  **Corporate Tax:** Taking away 25% - 30% of your hard-earned profits.

In 2026, **Commercial Solar** is the unique financial instrument that solves *both* problems simultaneously. It is one of the few assets that pays you back in two currencies: Energy and Tax Shields.

This guide explains specifically how **Section 32 of the Income Tax Act** works for business owners in Tamil Nadu.

## 1. What is Accelerated Depreciation (AD)?

In accounting, "Depreciation" is the reduction in the value of an asset over time due to wear and tear. You can deduct this loss from your profit before paying tax.
*   **Normal Machinery:** Depreciates at **15%** per year (Written Down Value).
*   **Solar Power Plants:** Categorized as "Renewable Energy Devices", they enjoy **40% Accelerated Depreciation** per year.

**Why does this matter?**
It allows you to book a massive "Loss" (Expense) in the very first year of purchase, significantly lowering your Taxable Income.

## 2. The [ROI](/blog/2026-01-08-solar-roi-calculator-break-even-analysis) Calculation: How Efficiency Meets Tax Savings

Let's simulate a standard business case for a Cuddalore factory.

**The Scenario:**
*   **System Size:** 20kW On-Grid Solar Plant.
*   **Total Invetsment:** ₹10,00,000 (10 Lakhs).
*   **Corporate Tax Rate:** 30% (including surcharge/cess).
*   **Electricity Tariff:** ₹10/unit.

### The Tax Shield Table (Section 32)

| Year | Opening Value (WDV) | Depreciation Rate | Depreciation Expense (Booked in P&L) | **Cash Saved (30% Tax Shield)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Year 1** | ₹10,00,000 | 40% | ₹4,00,000 | **₹1,20,000** |
| **Year 2** | ₹6,00,000 | 40% | ₹2,40,000 | **₹72,000** |
| **Year 3** | ₹3,60,000 | 40% | ₹1,44,000 | **₹43,200** |
| **Year 4** | ₹2,16,000 | 40% | ₹86,400 | **₹25,920** |
| **TOTAL** | | | | **~ ₹2.6 Lakhs** |

**Verdict:** You recover **26% of your project cost** purely through tax savings in 4 years.

### The Energy Savings Table

*   **Generation:** A 20kW plant generates approx 30,000 Units per year in Cuddalore.
*   **Bill Impact:** 30,000 x ₹10 = **₹3.0 Lakhs Saved per Year.**

### Total ROI Summary (Payback Period)
*   **Year 1 Inflow:** ₹3.0L (Energy) + ₹1.2L (Tax) = **₹4.2 Lakhs.**
*   **Year 2 Inflow:** ₹3.0L (Energy) + ₹0.72L (Tax) = **₹3.72 Lakhs.**
*   **Year 3 Inflow:** ₹3.0L (Energy) + ₹0.43L (Tax) = **₹3.43 Lakhs.**

**Cumulative Inflow by Year 3:** ₹11.35 Lakhs.
**Initial Investment:** ₹10 Lakhs.
**Payback Period:** **Less than 3 Years.**
After Year 3, the energy is effectively free for the next 22 years.

## 3. GST Input Tax Credit (ITC)

Apart from Income Tax, you also save on GST.
*   Solar Components typically attract **12% to 18% GST**.
*   If you are a GST-registered business, you can claim the **Input Tax Credit (ITC)** on the solar plant purchase against your output GST liability.
*   **Benefit:** This effectively reduces the "Real Cost" of the system by another 12-18%.

## 5. Comparison: Solar vs. Fixed Deposit (FD)

Many business owners ask: *"Why shouldn't I just put ₹10 Lakhs in an FD?"*

| Feature | Fixed Deposit (Bank) | Solar Power Plant |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ROI** | 7% per year | **30% - 40% per year** |
| **Tax Impact** | Interest is **Taxable** (You pay tax) | Depreciation is **Deductible** (You save tax) |
| **Risk** | Zero Risk | Low Risk (Technology is proven) |
| **Inflation** | Inflation eats your returns | Hedged against Electricity Inflation |
| **Asset Life** | Liquid Cash | 25 Year Asset |

**Conclusion:** Solar beats FD by a margin of 4X.

## 6. Filing Checklist for Your Chartered Accountant (CA)

To ensure your claim is not rejected by the IT Department, maintain this "Audit File":

1.  **Original Tax Invoice:** Must show the GSTIN of buyer and seller. Description should clearly say "Solar Power Generating System".
2.  **Commissioning Certificate:** Or a "Work Completion Report" signed by the installer.
3.  **Connectivity Proof:** The Safety Certificate from the Electrical Inspectorate (CEIG) or the [Net Meter](/blog/2026-01-04-how-to-get-tneb-net-meter-cuddalore-2026) installation report from TNEB.
4.  **September 30th Rule:**
    *   If the asset is "Put to Use" **before Sept 30**, you get 100% of the depreciation (40%).
    *   If installed **after Sept 30**, you get only 50% (20%) in that financial year. **(Pro Tip: Installation in March is bad for tax planning!)**.

5.  **Photographs:** Geo-tagged photos of the installed plant with the date.

## 7. Next Steps

If you are paying more than ₹20,000/month in electricity bills, you are losing money every day you wait.
Shift your expense from "Revenue Expenditure" (paying bills) to "Capital Expenditure" (building an asset).

**Don't pay TNEB. Don't pay Tax. Pay yourself.**
