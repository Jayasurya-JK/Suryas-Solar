"Sir, your quote is ₹1.9 Lakhs. But 'XYZ Solar' offered me ₹1.6 Lakhs. Why are you expensive?"

We welcome this question. It gives us a chance to save a customer from a disaster.
In Cuddalore, the solar market is booming. And where there is money, there are shortcuts. A "Cheap Quote" is never magic; it’s usually a compromise on safety, compliance, or longevity.

Solar is a 25-year product. If the installer cheats you today, you will pay for it for decades.
In **2026**, here are the **7 Dirty Tricks** unreliable installers use to lower their price—and why you will pay double for it later.

## 1. The "Sticker" Scam (Fake DCR)
The **[PM Surya Ghar](/blog/2026-01-01-pm-surya-ghar-scheme-cuddalore-2026)** subsidy strictly demands **DCR (Domestic Content Requirement)** panels—i.e., Indian cells and Indian modules.
*   **The Scam:** Unethical vendors buy cheaper imported/Chinese panels (which are 20% cheaper) and paste a fake "DCR" sticker on the back.
*   **The Result:** During the TNEB inspection, the AE scans the barcode. If it fails the ALMM (Approved List of Models and Manufacturers) database check, **Subsidy is Rejected.**
*   **The Loss:** You lose ₹78,000 subsidy to save ₹10,000 upfront.
*   **Our Fix:** We provide the **Original Factory Datasheet** and Flash Report matching the standard panel serial numbers. You can verify it on the manufacturer's website before installation.

## 2. The "Paint Job" Structure (Fake Galvanizing)
*   **The Scam:** The quote says "Galvanized Structure". In reality, they use cheap black iron pipes (MS) and spray paint them silver.
*   **The Test:** Scratch the pipe with a car key. If you see black metal underneath, it is fake.
*   **The Result:** In Cuddalore's salty air, the paint peels in 6 months. By Year 2, your structure is rusting. By Year 4, it is dangerously weak.
*   **Our Fix:** We use **Hot Dip Galvanized (80 micron)** steel. The zinc is bonded to the steel at 450°C. It is impossible to peel off.

## 3. Thin Wire Gauges (The Fire Hazard)
*   **The Scam:** Using 2.5sqmm DC cable instead of the standard 4sqmm or 6sqmm.
*   **The Result:** Thin wires heat up due to resistance. You lose 10% of your power as heat before it even reaches the inverter. In worst cases, the insulation melts, leading to a **DC Arc Fire**.
*   **Our Fix:** We use only Polycab/Siechem 4sqmm+ UV-protected solar cables.

## 4. The "Ghost" Warranty
*   **The Scam:** "25 Years Warranty!" claims the vendor who opened his shop last month. He offers a very low price to capture the market.
*   **The Result:** Solar inverters often need a fan cleaning or firmware update in Year 3. When you call him, the number is switched off. The company doesn't exist. You are left with an orphan system.
*   **Our Fix:** Solar is a service business. We have a physical office in Cuddalore. We aren't going anywhere. We answer the phone.

## 5. Excluding TNEB Charges (Hidden Costs)
*   **The Scam:** The quote looks low because it hides the ₹10,000 required for [Net Meter](/blog/2026-01-04-how-to-get-tneb-net-meter-cuddalore-2026), Official Fees, Liaisoning, and Safety Letter.
*   **The Result:** After you pay the advance, they say, *"Sir, you have to pay TNEB fees separately."* You end up paying *more* in total.
*   **Our Fix:** Our pricing is **"All-Inclusive"**. From Application to Commissioning, the price is fixed. No surprises.

## 6. Under-Sizing the [Earthing](/blog/2026-01-13-solar-earthing-safety-guide)
*   **The Scam:** Using a 3ft iron rod instead of a proper 2-meter Chemical Earthing ([Maintenance](/blog/2026-01-10-solar-maintenance-guide-cuddalore) Free) kit.
*   **The Result:** Solar panels on a roof are a lightning magnet. If lightning strikes near your home, and your earthing is weak, your ₹50,000 Inverter fries instantly. Warranty does *not* cover lightning damage.
*   **Our Fix:** We install 3 separate Earthing Pits (DC, AC, LA) filled with Backfill Compound (BFC) to ensure resistance < 5 Ohms.

## 7. The "Mixed Bin" Panels
*   **The Scam:** Buying "B-Grade" panels (visual defects or micro-cracks) rejected by factories at a discount.
*   **The Result:** It works fine for Year 1. But micro-cracks spread with heat. Your generation drops by 50% in 5 years.
*   **Our Fix:** We only procure A-Grade panels directly from distributors, not from the grey market.

##  How to Protect Yourself? (The Checklist)

Before you sign any check, ask the installer for:
1.  **ALMM Certificate:** Proof that the panel brand is Govt approved.
2.  **Structure Sample:** Ask to see a physical piece of the structure pipe.
3.  **Reference:** Ask to visit a site they installed **3 years ago**. (New sites always look good. Old sites tell the truth).

**Don't bet your roof on the lowest bidder.**
Quality is remembered long after the price is forgotten.
