In recent years, households across **Tamil Nadu** have rapidly adopted solar power to combat rising electricity bills. However, despite the clear benefits, many homeowners hesitate to install solar due to persistent myths and misunderstandings.

These myths often stem from outdated information, rumors, or bad experiences with poor-quality installations from a decade ago. In this guide, we clear up the confusion with factual data specific to the climate and conditions of **Tamil Nadu and Puducherry**. At **Surya’s Solar**, we have installed systems across **Cuddalore, Panruti, Neyveli, and Puducherry**, and we believe an informed customer is a happy customer.

## Myth vs Fact Section (Top 10)

Let's tackle the biggest misunderstandings head-on.

### MYTH 1: Solar works only when sunlight is very strong
**FACT:** Solar panels work on light intensity (photons), not just heat. Even in cloudy weather, modern panels generate power.
*   **The Reality:** In Tamil Nadu, you can achieve 4–5 units/kW even during cloudy seasons. While generation drops during heavy rain, diffuse light still produces energy.
*   **Tech Update:** Modern **Mono PERC** and **Bifacial** panels are designed to capture low-light energy efficiently, making them perfect for early mornings and late evenings.

### MYTH 2: Solar makes “Zero Bill” for everyone
**FACT:** A "Zero Bill" is possible but not guaranteed for everyone. It depends entirely on your system size versus your consumption.
*   **The Reality:** A 3kW–5kW system can eliminate bills for many homes, but if you run 3 ACs all night on a 3kW system, you will still have a bill.
*   **The Math:** Net-metering calculates the difference between import and export. If you export more than you import, your bill is zero (plus fixed charges). If you consume more, you pay the difference.

### MYTH 3: Solar panels damage the roof
**FACT:** This is a major fear that is completely unfounded when professional installation is done.
*   **The Reality:** We use MNRE-approved structures (GI, Hot-Dip, or RCC) that protect your roof.
*   **Our Method:** For RCC roofs, we use concrete pedestals (blocks) so there is **no drilling** into the roof slab. This ensures zero leaks and no structural damage. The weight of the system is distributed safely.

### MYTH 4: Solar doesn’t work in coastal areas like Pondicherry & Cuddalore
**FACT:** Solar performs excellently in coastal zones due to high light intensity.
*   **The Reality:** The only challenge is rust, not generation. Puducherry's sunlight is actually ideal for high generation.
*   **The Solution:** We use **Hot-Dip Galvanized** structures (80+ microns zinc coating) and corrosion-resistant panels to prevent rust from the salty air. With the right materials, coastal solar is a winner.

### MYTH 5: Solar cannot run AC
**FACT:** Solar absolutely CAN run ACs. This is the biggest myth of all!
*   **3kW System:** Can run one 1.5-ton AC comfortably for 4-5 hours during the day.
*   **5kW System:** Can run 1–2 ACs easily during the day along with other loads.
*   **Hybrid Inverters:** Can even run ACs during power cuts if the battery bank is sufficient (though this drains batteries quickly).

### MYTH 6: Solar panels need cleaning every day
**FACT:** You only need to clean panels **2–3 times a month** to maintain efficiency.
*   **The Reality:** In summer, dust builds up faster, requiring cleaning every 10 days. During the monsoon, the rain does the job for you!
*   **Why it matters:** A layer of dust can reduce output by 15-20%, so periodic cleaning is important, but daily scrubbing is unnecessary.

### MYTH 7: Poly panels are cheaper and enough for homes
**FACT:** Polycrystalline technology (blue panels) is outdated.
*   **The Reality:** While cheaper upfront, they are less efficient, degrade faster, and require more roof space.
*   **Recommendation:** **Mono PERC and TOPCon** panels (black panels) offer 20–22% efficiency, better low-light performance, and a much better ROI over 25 years. The slight price difference is worth it for the extra generation.

### MYTH 8: Solar battery is compulsory
**FACT:** Batteries are **optional**.
*   **The Reality:** Most homes in Tamil Nadu install **On-Grid systems** which do not need batteries. They use the grid as a virtual battery via net-metering.
*   **When to buy:** You only need batteries if you want backup power during frequent outages (Hybrid system) or live in an area with no grid (Off-Grid). For saving money, On-Grid is best.

### MYTH 9: Net-metering installation is very hard
**FACT:** While the government process involves paperwork, it is not "hard" for the customer because the vendor does it.
*   **The Reality:** **Surya’s Solar** handles the entire TNEB/PED approval process for you. It typically takes 2–4 weeks depending on the region. You just need to provide documents; we handle the liaisoning.

### MYTH 10: Solar is too expensive
**FACT:** Solar is more affordable than ever, especially with the **PM Surya Ghar Subsidy**.
*   **1kW:** ~₹40,000 (after subsidy)
*   **2kW:** ~₹80,000 (after subsidy)
*   **3kW:** ~₹1.1 Lakh (after subsidy)
*   **ROI:** With a payback period of just 3–5 years and a lifespan of 25 years, it is one of the best financial investments you can make—better than a fixed deposit!

## Myth vs Fact Table (Quick Summary)

| Myth | Reality |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Solar can’t run AC** | 5kW system runs 1–2 ACs easily |
| **Solar damages roof** | MNRE structures protect roofs; no drilling options available |
| **Needs daily cleaning** | Only 2–3 times/month is sufficient |
| **Works only in summer** | Works all year round, even in cloudy weather |
| **Battery required** | Optional; On-grid systems work without batteries |
| **Hard net-metering** | Simple process; installer handles approvals |
| **Zero bill guaranteed** | Possible only if Export > Import |
| **Poly panels are fine** | Mono PERC/TOPCon offer far better ROI |

## State-Specific Clarifications (TN + Puducherry)

### Tamil Nadu
*   **Strong Sunlight:** One of the best states for solar generation. The dry heat in **Panruti and Neyveli** is particularly good for solar efficiency.
*   **Stable Grid:** Most urban areas have a stable grid, making On-Grid systems the most financially rewarding choice.
*   **TNEB Rules:** TNEB has strict safety standards for net-metering, which ensures your system is safe and reliable.

### Puducherry
*   **Coastal Climate:** Requires rust-proof structures. Standard iron will rust in months. We use specialized materials for **Pondicherry** installations.
*   **Power Cuts:** Occasional power cuts mean Hybrid systems are more popular here to provide backup for lights and fans.

## Why Homeowners Believe Myths

Why do these myths persist?
1.  **Old Technology:** People remember the inefficient solar of 10 years ago and assume nothing has changed.
2.  **Hearsay:** Wrong information spreads from neighbors who might have had bad installations from unverified vendors.
3.  **WhatsApp:** Viral messages often contain unverified claims about "free energy" or "hidden costs."
4.  **Lack of Knowledge:** Many don't know about new technologies like Mono PERC, Half-Cut cells, or Net-Metering benefits.
