Choosing the right solar panel is one of the most critical decisions when switching to solar energy. With various technologies available in the market, it can be overwhelming to decide which one fits your home and budget.

In this guide, we break down the most common types of solar panels available in India and help you choose the best one for your needs.

## 1. Polycrystalline Solar Panels

Polycrystalline panels are the most common and affordable type of solar panels in India. They are easily recognizable by their blue speckled color.

**Pros:**
*   Cost-effective
*   Eco-friendly manufacturing process

**Cons:**
*   Lower efficiency compared to Monocrystalline
*   Requires more space

## 2. Monocrystalline PERC Panels

Monocrystalline panels are made from a single crystal structure, giving them a uniform black look. PERC (Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell) technology further enhances their efficiency.

**Pros:**
*   High efficiency
*   Works better in low light conditions
*   Space-efficient

**Cons:**
*   More expensive than Polycrystalline

## 3. Bifacial Solar Panels

Bifacial panels can generate electricity from both the front and back sides. They capture sunlight reflected from the roof or ground, increasing total energy generation.

**Pros:**
*   Higher energy generation (up to 30% more)
*   Durable and long-lasting

**Cons:**
*   Requires specific installation setup (elevated mounting)
*   Higher cost

## Which One Should You Choose?

*   **For Budget:** Go for Polycrystalline.
*   **For Efficiency & Limited Space:** Monocrystalline PERC is the best choice.
*   **For Maximum Output:** Bifacial panels are ideal if you have a reflective surface (white roof).

At **Surya's Solar**, we recommend **Monocrystalline PERC** panels for most residential rooftops in Cuddalore as they offer the best balance of performance and value.
