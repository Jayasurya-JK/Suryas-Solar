"Sir, are these panels 'Self-Cleaning'?"

We hear this question often. The honest answer is: **No.**
While occasional rain helps, it rarely cleans the sticky dust layer that forms in Cuddalore's humid, coastal climate. The salt in the air mixes with dust to form a grime layer that feels almost like cement.

In **2026**, the biggest reason for "Low Generation" complaints isn't faulty inverters or bad wiring—it is simply **Dust.**

A dirty solar panel is like a dirty car windshield. If light can't get in, power can't get out.
Field studies in Tamil Nadu show that a thick layer of dust can reduce your solar output by **15% to 25%**.
*   **The Math:** If a 3kW system loses 20%, you lose 3 to 4 units every single day.
*   **The Loss:** That is approx ₹24/day = **₹8,500 lost per year.**

Here is the definitive maintenance guide to keep your plant running at 100% efficiency for 25 years.

## 1. The Maintenance Calendar (Cuddalore Edition)

Depending on the season, your cleaning schedule must change. Cuddalore has three distinct dust seasons.

| Season | Months | Dust Level | Cleaning Frequency |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Summer** | Mar - Jun | **EXTREME** | Every 7 - 10 Days |
| **Monsoon** | Oct - Dec | Low (Rain helps) | Once a Month |
| **Winter** | Jan - Feb | Moderate | Every 15 Days |

**Best Time to Clean:**
*   **Early Morning (6 AM - 8 AM):** This is the Golden Hour. Panels are cool from the night.
*   **Late Evening (5 PM - 7 PM):** Acceptable, but you might lose daylight visibility.
*   **Danger Zone:** **NEVER** clean panels in the hot afternoon (11 AM - 3 PM). The glass can reach 60°C - 70°C. Pouring cold water on hot glass causes **Thermal Shock**, which can shatter the tempered glass instantly.

## 2. The Science of Water Quality (TDS Warning)

This is the most common mistake homeowners make.
**Can I use bore water?**
It depends on the **TDS (Total Dissolved Solids)**.
*   **Bore Water (>500 ppm):** NO. Cuddalore bore water is often hard (salty). If you let it dry on the glass, it leaves white calcium spots ("Scale"). These spots are permanent and block sunlight.
*   **RO Reject Water:** YES. If you have an RO purifier, the reject water is perfect for cleaning (ironically, it often has fewer scaling minerals than raw bore water in some stages, but ideally use **Soft Water**).
*   **Rain Water:** The Best. It has zero TDS.

**Pro Tip:** If you must use bore water, you **MUST** use a wiper (squeegee) to remove every drop of water before it dries. If the water is removed, the salt is removed. If the water evaporates, the salt stays.

## 3. The "Do's and Don'ts" of Cleaning

### DO:
1.  **Use a Soft Brush/Mop:** Use a microfiber mop (like the ones used for car washing). It lifts dust without scratching.
2.  **Use a Squeegee:** A rubber wiper blade is your best friend. It leaves the glass streak-free.
3.  **Inspect While Cleaning:** Look for bird droppings. Bird poop is acidic and can burn the glass if left for months. Scrub it off gently.

### DON'T:
1.  **NO Detergents:** Soap, Surf, or Shampoo leaves a sticky microscopic film. This film attracts *more* dust within 2 days. Plain water is best.
2.  **NO Abrasives:** Never use Scotch-Brite, metal scrubbers, or rough cloth. Scratches on the Anti-Reflective Coating (ARC) reduce efficiency permanently.
3.  **NO Pressure Washers:** Do not use a high-pressure car washer aimed closely at the panels. The pressure can damage the silicone seals between the glass and frame, causing water ingress and delamination.




## 4. The DIY Cleaning Kit Checklist

You don't need expensive machines. You just need the right tools found in any hardware store in Manjakuppam.
1.  **Telescopic Pole (3m - 6m):** Essential safety tool. It lets you reach the top panels while standing safely on the roof, without climbing onto the structure.
2.  **Microfiber Mop Head:** Soft and absorbent.
3.  **Rubber Squeegee:** Quality rubber (like Unger) works best.
4.  **Hose Pipe with Spray Gun:** Gentle shower setting.



## 5. The "Health Check" (Every 6 Months)

Cleaning is about generation. Maintenance is about safety. Do a quick visual check every 6 months:

### A. Cable Inspection
Look underneath the panels (without touching wires).
*   Are any wires hanging loose and touching the roof?
*   Are there rat bites? Rats love chewing solar [cables](/blog/2026-01-14-solar-dc-cable-quality-guide).
*   **Action:** If you see damaged wires, **DO NOT TOUCH**. Call us immediately. Voltage can be lethal even at night.

### B. Structure Rust Check
Look for orange spots on the nuts, bolts, and joints.
*   Cuddalore's salty air attacks galvanized steel.
*   **Action:** If you see rust, purchase a can of **"Cold Galvanizing Zinc Spray"** and spray it on the affected area to stop corrosion.

### C. Inverter Health
Check the display on your Inverter.
*   **Green Light (Normal):** System is generating.
*   **Red Light (Fault):** Note down the error code (e.g., Error 102) and contact support.
*   **Generation Check:** Compare today's generation with the same day last month. If it's dropped significantly without cloudy weather, something is wrong.

## 6. Safety First: The Golden Rules

Never compromise your life for a few units of electricity.
1.  **Don't Walk on Panels:** Micro-cracks will form invisible to the eye, destroying the panel.
2.  **Wet Roof Hazard:** Algae forms on roofs. When wet, it is like ice. Wear anti-slip shoes.
3.  **Electrical Safety:** Never clean panels if you see broken glass or exposed wires. Water conducts electricity.

**Conclusion:**
A well-maintained solar plant is a 25-year asset that prints money. Neglect it, and it becomes a liability. Keep it clean, keep it safe.
