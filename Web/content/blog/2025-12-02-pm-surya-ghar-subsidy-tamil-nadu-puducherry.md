## What Is PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana?

In simple terms, this is a central government initiative to promote rooftop solar adoption. It aims to reduce the financial burden on households while promoting green energy.

*   **Goal:** To provide up to 300 units of free electricity per month to 1 crore households across India.
*   **Benefit:** A substantial subsidy (financial assistance) is credited directly to your bank account after the system is installed.
*   **Scope:** Applicable to all residential homes in **Tamil Nadu and Puducherry**.
*   **Portal:** Applications are processed through the official portal: [pmsuryaghar.gov.in](https://pmsuryaghar.gov.in).

For a typical middle-class family in **Cuddalore** paying ₹2,000–₹3,000 in monthly bills, this scheme effectively makes electricity free for life after the initial investment is recovered.

## Important Rules for Tamil Nadu & Puducherry

Local regulations play a key role in the process.

### Tamil Nadu (TNEB)
*   **Net Metering:** Mandatory for all on-grid systems. TNEB is very strict about safety standards, so professional installation is key.
*   **Clearance:** Specific height clearance rules apply for panel mounting structures. We ensure your structure meets these norms.
*   **Timeline:** TNEB inspections typically happen within 1-2 weeks of installation in districts like **Cuddalore and Panruti**.
*   **Potential:** With 300+ sunny days, TN homeowners see the fastest ROI in the country.

### Puducherry (PED)
*   **Approvals:** Follows a similar process to TN but through the Puducherry Electricity Department.
*   **Climate:** Due to high humidity and salty air, choosing corrosion-resistant panels (like Glass-to-Glass or TOPCon) is crucial, even if they cost slightly more.
*   **Process:** Net metering approvals are generally quicker in Puducherry compared to larger states.
