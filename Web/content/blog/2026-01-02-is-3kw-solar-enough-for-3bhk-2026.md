"Sir, I have a standard 3BHK house—3 bedrooms, a hall, a kitchen. We have two ACs, a fridge, and a washing machine. Is a 3kW system enough, or will I regret not buying 5kW?"

This is, without a doubt, the single most frequent question we receive at our Cuddalore office. And in **2026**, the answer is more important than ever because electricity consumption patterns are changing. Families now have larger refrigerators, more gadgets, and often, an Electric Scooter.

A 3kW system is the "Goldilocks" size—it hits the maximum [subsidy](/blog/2026-01-01-pm-surya-ghar-scheme-cuddalore-2026) cap (₹78,000) and fits on most rooftops. But does it actually cover your bill?

In this deep-dive guide, we move beyond guesswork. We will calculate the math, physics, and economics of running a modern Tamil Nadu 3BHK household on 3kW of solar power.

##  Technical Breakdown: What is a "3kW" System?

Before we talk about running your AC, you need to understand what you are actually buying. In 2026, solar technology has improved. Panels are more efficient, meaning you need less roof space than you did five years ago.

### The Specs of a Modern 3kW Plant:
*   **Panel Count:** Approx. 5 to 6 High-Efficiency Mono-PERC or Bifacial Panels (540Wp - 590Wp each).
*   **Roof Area Needed:** ~250 to 300 square feet of [shadow](/blog/2026-01-12-solar-shadow-analysis-guide-cuddalore)-free space.
*   **Inverter Capacity:** 3.3 kVA (Grid-Tied).
*   **Daily Generation:** 12 to 15 Units (kWh) on a clear day in Cuddalore.

> **Key Concept:** A 3kW system does NOT mean you can only turn on 3000W of appliances at once.
> *   **On-Grid:** You can turn on 10kW of load if you want! Use 3kW from solar and 7kW from TNEB instantly.
> *   **The Goal:** It's not about *peak load*, it's about *total energy offset* over a month.

##  The 3BHK Load Audit: Where Does Power Go?

To know if 3kW is "enough," we must audit your consumption. Let's analyze a typical middle-class family in Cuddalore during a **Summer Month (Peak Usage)**.

### Priority 1: The Heavy Hitters (ACs & Geysers)
Modern 1.5 Ton **Inverter ACs** are surprisingly efficient. They don't run at full power all the time.
*   **Startup:** Consumes ~1600W.
*   **Running (Steady State):** Drops to ~600W - 900W once the room is cool.

### Priority 2: The "Always On" (Fridge & Wi-Fi)
Your 300L Double Door Fridge feels like a heavy load, but it cycles on and off. It likely consumes only 1.5 to 2 units per day.

### Priority 3: The Intermittent Load (Mixie, Motor, Washing Machine)
These run for short bursts (15-30 mins). They spike the load but add little to the total "Units" (kWh).

##  The Daily Math: 3kW Generation vs. 3BHK Consumption

Let's simulate a 24-hour cycle to see if the math holds up.

| Time of Day | Family Activity | Power Source | [Net Meter](/blog/2026-01-04-how-to-get-tneb-net-meter-cuddalore-2026) Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **6 AM - 9 AM** | Geyser (30 mins), Coffee Maker, Motor Pump. Solar generation is low (morning sun). | **Grid + Solar** | Small Import from TNEB. |
| **9 AM - 5 PM** | **PEAK SOLAR HOURS.** House is empty (work/school) or light load (Fans/TV). AC implies huge generation (3kW). | **Solar** | **Massive EXPORT to Grid.** (Banking Units). |
| **5 PM - 7 PM** | Lights, Cooking, TV. Solar generation fades. | **Solar + Grid** | Neutral / Small Import. |
| **7 PM - 6 AM** | ACs ON (Bedroom), Lights, Fans. Solar is OFF. | **Grid** | **Massive IMPORT from TNEB.** |

### The "Banking" Magic
This is where people get confused. "Solar doesn't work at night, so how does it run my AC?"
It doesn't.
**At night, you run your AC using the "Banked Units" you sent to TNEB during the afternoon.**

### The Final Calculation
*   **3kW Generation:** ~14 Units/Day (Avg)
*   **Typical 3BHK Consumption:**
    *   1 AC (8 hours): 8 Units
    *   Fridge + Fans + Lights: 4 Units
    *   Washing Machine + Misc: 2 Units
    *   **Total:** 14 Units/Day

**Result:** 14 Units Generated - 14 Units Consumed = **ZERO BILL.**

##  The "Two AC" Problem

What if you run **two** ACs simultaneously every night?
*   **Load:** ~20 Units/Day.
*   **Generation:** 14 Units/Day.
*   **Deficit:** 6 Units/Day.
*   **Monthly Deficit:** 180 Units.

Does this mean 3kW is useless? **No.**
It means you will drop from the "Luxury Slab" (₹8/unit) to the "Subsidized Slab" (₹2.50 or ₹4.50/unit). Your bill won't be zero, but it will drop from **₹4,000 to ₹800**. That is still a massive win.

##  TNEB Slab Rates: Why "Partial" Solar Works

In Tamil Nadu, electricity pricing is tiered. The more you use, the higher the rate for *every* unit.
*   **>500 Units:** You pay a premium penalty rate.
*   **<500 Units:** You pay subsidized rates.

Even if a 3kW system doesn't make your bill "Zero", it acts as an **anchor**, dragging your consumption down into the cheap slabs. By removing the top layer of expensive consumption, the [ROI](/blog/2026-01-08-solar-roi-calculator-break-even-analysis) remains fantastic.

---

##  -  Future Proofing: EV Charging

It is 2026. You might have an electric scooter (Ola/Ather/TVS) or plan to buy one.
*   **Scooter Charge:** ~3 to 4 Units per full charge.
*   **Impact:** If you charge daily, that consumes ~25% of a 3kW system's output.

If you plan to buy an EV, we strongly recommend considering a **4kW or 5kW** system upgrade immediately, as adding panels later requires changing the inverter, which is expensive.

##  The Verdict: Is 3kW Enough?

Here is the Surya's Solar decision matrix for 2026:

| Household Profile | Verdict | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2BHK / Small 3BHK (1 AC usage)** | **YES (Perfect)** | You will likely have a Zero Bill and surplus credits. |
| **3BHK (Heavy 1 AC usage + Gaming/PC)** | **YES (Good)** | Near Zero bill. Best ROI relative to investment. |
| **3BHK (2 ACs regular usage)** | **NO (Upgrade)** | You need **5kW**. 3kW will save money but won't wipe the bill. |
| **Home + EV Car** | **NO (Upgrade)** | You need **5kW to 6kW** minimum to cover the car charging. |

## Ready to Calculate Your Exact Load?

Estimation is good, but measurement is better. Every house is unique. A shadow from a neighbor's water tank or an old inefficient refrigerator can change the math.

At **Surya's Solar**, we offer a precise **Site Feasibility Audit**. We check your sanctioned load, measure your roof shadow patterns, and look at your actual appliance list to give you a "Generation Guarantee".

**Don't guess with your investment.**
