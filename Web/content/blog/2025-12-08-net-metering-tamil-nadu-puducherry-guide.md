For most homeowners, the primary reason to install solar is to cut down on electricity bills. The mechanism that makes this possible is called **Net-Metering**. It allows you to "store" your excess solar power in the grid and use it when needed, effectively turning the electricity grid into a giant battery for your home.

However, the rules and processes for net-metering differ between **Tamil Nadu (TNEB)** and **Puducherry (PED)**. With 2025 bringing new policy updates, it's crucial to understand how the system works to maximize your savings.

At **Surya’s Solar**, we don't just install panels; we handle the entire net-metering application, documentation, and approval process for our customers in **Cuddalore, Panruti, Neyveli, and Puducherry**. This guide explains everything from how the meter works to billing calculations and common pitfalls to avoid.

## What Is Net-Metering? (Simple Explanation)

Think of net-metering as a banking system for electricity. It tracks the energy you produce versus the energy you consume.

1.  **Generation:** Your solar panels generate DC electricity during the day.
2.  **Conversion:** Your inverter converts this to AC power for your home.
3.  **Consumption:** Your home appliances (lights, fans, fridge) use this solar power *first*. This is "free" power that doesn't even touch the meter.
4.  **Export:** If your ACs are off and you're generating more than you need, the *extra* electricity flows back to the government grid.
5.  **Import:** At night, when solar isn't working, you draw power from the grid as usual.
6.  **Billing:** The "Net Meter" records both Import and Export. Your bill is based on the **Net Consumption** (Import - Export).

## How Net-Metering Works in Tamil Nadu (TN-Specific)

The process in Tamil Nadu is straightforward but requires strict adherence to TANGEDCO guidelines.

### The Flow of Power
*   **Daytime (8 AM - 4 PM):** Your solar system is active. If you generate 15 units but only use 5 units, the remaining **10 units are exported** to the TNEB grid.
*   **Nighttime (6 PM - 6 AM):** Your solar system is off. You import power from the grid to run your lights and ACs.
*   **Billing Cycle:** At the end of the billing period (usually bi-monthly in TN), TNEB calculates the difference.

### The Calculation Formula
> **Billable Units = (Total Import Units) - (Total Export Units)**

**Example Scenario:**
*   **Import (from TNEB):** 500 units (mostly at night).
*   **Export (to TNEB):** 450 units (during the day).
*   **Net Billable Units:** 500 - 450 = **50 Units**.
*   **Result:** You only pay for 50 units!

If you export *more* than you import (e.g., Export 600, Import 500), the extra 100 units are carried forward as a credit to your next bill.

## How Net-Metering Works in Puducherry (PED-Specific)

In **Puducherry**, the Electricity Department (PED) manages the grid. The core principle is the same, but there are local advantages.

*   **Faster Processing:** Approvals in Puducherry are generally faster than in TN, often completed within 2-3 weeks.
*   **High Generation:** Coastal houses in **Pondicherry** receive intense sunlight, leading to higher export units.
*   **Inverter Rules:** PED is supportive of hybrid inverters, which is great for residents who want battery backup during occasional power cuts.

Residents in **Pondicherry** can significantly benefit from this, especially given the rising cooling needs in the coastal humidity.

## Types of Meters Used (2025 Update)

The technology is evolving. Here are the meters you might see installed in your home.

### a) Bi-Directional Meter (The Standard)
This is the most common digital meter installed for solar homes.
*   **Display:** It cycles through different readings: Date, Time, Import (kWh), and Export (kWh).
*   **Function:** It replaces your old unidirectional meter.

### b) Smart Meter (New Rollout)
These are being rolled out in select areas of Tamil Nadu.
*   **Feature:** They send real-time data to the DISCOM.
*   **Benefit:** You can track your exact usage via a mobile app, eliminating billing errors.

### c) Gross Metering (Commercial Only)
In this system, *all* solar power is exported to the grid, and you import *all* your needs. You are paid a fixed rate for generation.
*   **Verdict:** This is rare for homes and mostly used for large commercial setups or educational institutions.

## Net-Metering Eligibility (TN + Puducherry)

Before applying, check if you qualify.

### Tamil Nadu (TNEB)
*   **System Size:** Minimum 1 kW, Maximum 10 kW for residential (LT).
*   **Connection:** Single-phase or 3-phase service connection.
*   **Inverter:** Must be grid-tied or hybrid with **anti-islanding protection** (automatically shuts off during power cuts).
*   **Vendor:** Must be installed by a DISCOM-approved vendor like **Surya’s Solar**.

### Puducherry (PED)
*   **Property:** Individual house with a valid domestic connection.
*   **Capacity:** Up to 100% of your sanctioned load is allowed.
*   **Inverter:** Hybrid inverters are allowed and encouraged due to power cuts.

## Application Process (Step-by-Step)

We handle this headache for you, but here is the checklist so you know what happens.

1.  **Rooftop Inspection:** We verify structural stability and ensure you have a shadow-free area.
2.  **Online Application:** We submit the application to the TANGEDCO or PED portal with your consumer number.
3.  **Document Submission:** Aadhaar, Electricity Bill, Property Tax receipt.
4.  **Feasibility Approval:** The Assistant Engineer (AE) visits to check the transformer capacity and approves the technical feasibility.
5.  **Installation:** We install the solar system as per MNRE standards (DCR panels, proper earthing).
6.  **Technical Inspection:** TNEB/PED officials inspect the safety and quality of the installation.
7.  **Meter Installation:** You pay the meter fees. The old meter is removed, and the new Net Meter is installed and sealed.
8.  **Activation:** The system is switched on, and your savings begin immediately!

## Net-Metering Charges & Billing Rules (2025)

There are some costs involved in the setup that you should budget for.

*   **TN Charges:** You need to pay for the Net Meter itself (approx ₹3,000 - ₹5,000) and a one-time testing fee to TNEB.
*   **Puducherry Charges:** Minimal application fees.
*   **Billing Cycle:** Your bill remains monthly or bi-monthly as per your existing cycle.
*   **Carry Forward:** If you have excess credit, it carries forward for 12 months. At the end of the financial year, some DISCOMs may settle this at a nominal rate, but the primary goal is self-consumption.

## Example Bill Calculations

Let's see the real math for two typical scenarios.

### Example A: 3 kW System in Cuddalore (TN)
*   **Total Consumption:** 400 units (2 months)
*   **Solar Generation (Self-used):** 150 units
*   **Solar Exported:** 200 units
*   **Grid Import:** 250 units
*   **Net Bill:** 250 (Import) - 200 (Export) = **50 Units**.
*   **Result:** You pay for only 50 units! The bill drops from approx ₹2,000 to just ₹150 (fixed charges).

### Example B: 5 kW System in Pondy
*   **Grid Import:** 220 units
*   **Solar Export:** 240 units
*   **Net Bill:** 220 - 240 = **-20 Units**.
*   **Result:** Zero Bill + 20 units credit carried forward to the next month.

| **Meter Type** | Bi-directional / Smart | Bi-directional |
| **Meter Cost** | Higher | Lower |
| **Ideal For** | 1–10 kW | 1–5 kW |
| **Climate Impact** | Heat + Dust | Coastal salt + wind |

## Common Mistakes Homeowners Make

Avoid these pitfalls to ensure smooth net-metering.

1.  **Expecting Zero Bill with Small Systems:** A 1kW system won't eliminate a ₹5,000 bill. You need to size the system correctly (usually 3kW+ for ACs).
2.  **Wrong Inverter:** Using a non-approved inverter leads to rejection during the inspection.
3.  **Shade Issues:** Even a little shade on one panel can drastically reduce the output of the whole string, reducing your export units.
4.  **No Earthing:** TNEB will strictly reject the installation if earthing is poor or resistance is high.
5.  **Not Checking Generation:** You must monitor your app to ensure the system is actually exporting. If the Wi-Fi disconnects, you might not know if the system is down.
